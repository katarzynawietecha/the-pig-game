            <p>The game has two players, playing in rounds. In each turn, you roll a dice as many times as you whish. Each result get added to your round score. But, if you roll a 1, all your round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn. You can choose to "hold", which means that your round score gets added to your global score. After that, it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach 40 points on global score wins the game!</p>
